# Skilling Tweaks

In Wurm Unlimited skill gain only cares about success or failure, meaning the easiest action is usually the best way to skill from level 1 until 100.  This mod adds some options to move from that monotony with many more viable ways to skill.
### **Features:**
* **Timed skilling** - WU actions are hard coded as having taken 10 seconds to complete.  This re-adds the time an action took as part of the skill gain, levelling the playing field for fast vs slow actions.
_Many skills also adjust skill gain using this which has been missing in WU, such as double skill gain for improving items high enough over your skill level, thirding creation skill gain, and only getting half when using the wrong tool in archaeology._
* **WO-like** - Only give skill gain when skill check success is between 0 and 40 (Cap of 40 only starts after skill level 20) and removes gaining skill on failures before 20, the same as WO (I think).  WO also uses timed skilling.
* **Difficulty scaling** - More difficult actions give more skill gain.  For every difficulty level over 5 a configurable multiplier is added, e.g. 0.1 would mean 55 difficulty actions would give 50 x .1 -> +5x the skill gain.  Not added to the under level 20 skill gain on failures.
